# FogIndex
Fog Index Calculator for text files
this is a simple Fog Index Calculator which follows the following rules.

How to calculate Fog index

Step 1:Count the total number of words in the passage.

Step 2:Count the number of sentences in the passage.

Step 3:Count the average number of words in each sentence (by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences). For example, a 100-word passage comprising 10 sentences would have an average sentence length of 100/10 or 10 words).

Step 4:Count the number of words having three syllables or more in the passage.

While calculating, do not add the following:

a. Words that are capitalized (such as proper nouns, e.g.. Bangalore, Minneapolis, Jawaharlal, etc.)

b. Words that are a combination of short easy words such as undertake, bookkeeping, anyone and multinational.

c. Verb forms whose number of syllables have increased by the addition of -ed, -es or -ing) such as credited.

Step 5:Add the last two numbers (derived in steps 3 and 4 above).

Step 6:Take four-tenths of this total.

The final result determines the fog index or clarity index. Here, like golf, low scores are desirable and imply high clarity (or less foggy) English.
